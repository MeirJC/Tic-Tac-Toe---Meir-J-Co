This is Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe

Board size can be changed toe sizes varying from 3 by 3 grids to 7 by 7 grids, and what's also spacial comparing the regular versions is that this game has 2 modes:

- Pro Mode (which is the default) - This mode require you to get the full line across the grid (in any direction you wish - row/ column / both of the diagonal).
  this gets harder and harder to accomplish while the board gets bigger...

- Easy Mode - in this mode you need to have only 3 adjacent makes (in any direction of course)

Another thing to keep in mind is that the winner gets to start in the next round.

I've had a really great time building this project and I hope you will enjoy it ðŸ˜Ž
many logic and math games involved to getting just the right indexes. and also manipulating the DOM is many ways was a new challenge.

ive tried to insert much documentation in the code, but if this interesting and may have any questions occurs, feel free to reach me here or at my [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/meirjcohen)

### have fun playing
