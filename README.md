This is Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe

Board size can be changed to sizes varying from 3 by 3 grids to 7 by 7 grids, and what's also spacial comparing to the regular versions is that this game has 2 modes:

- **Pro Mode** (default) - This mode require you to get the full line across the grid (in any direction you wish - row/ column / both of the diagonal).
  this gets harder and harder to accomplish while the board gets bigger...

- **Easy Mode** - in this mode you only need to have 3 adjacent player marks in the same direction to win (row/col/diagonal)

Another thing to keep in mind is that the WINNER 🏆 gets to start first in the next round. so hard work pays off :)

I've had a really great time building this project and I hope you will enjoy it 😎
Many logic and math games was involved to getting just the right indexes. and also manipulating the DOM in many ways was a new challenge.

I have tried to include lots of documentation/explanations in the code (mostly in the JS file), but if you find this interesting and have any questions about the code or process, feel free to reach out to me here or at my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/meirjcohen)
